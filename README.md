# 2D audio visualisation

This is an audio visualisation.  It slices up the audio into overlapping chunks, takes the spectrum of each, and synthesises a 2D field with the same spectrum.

It supports layering tracks on top of each other in different colours, which can give good results: an example video can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8bg1ey5siy9y490/Lay%20Your%20Voice%20Down%20%28large%29.mp4?dl=1).
